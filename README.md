# L-GPT

## No Templates. No Training Wheels.  
**Written by Lary**

---

This repo does **not** give you templates.

Why?

Because templates make people lazy, and lazy people break shit and then ask dumb questions.

**L‑GPT (No Template Edition)** exists for people who already understand:
- how prompts work
- how personas work
- and why ChatGPT doesn’t magically remember everything forever

If that’s not you, turn around now.

---

## What This Repo Is

- A place to store **raw persona prompts**
- Fully written characters, no blanks
- Copy → paste → use
- Each persona is intentional, opinionated, and finished

No “insert name here” nonsense.

---

## What This Repo Is NOT

- ❌ Not a tutorial
- ❌ Not beginner‑friendly
- ❌ Not a jailbreak
- ❌ Not memory injection
- ❌ Not Base64 wizardry

If you don’t know why those things won’t work, that’s on you.

## How To Use It

1. Open a persona file  
2. Read it (yes, actually read it)  
3. Paste it into a new chat  
4. Follow whatever activation rules it includes  

That’s it.  
No setup. No switches. No crying when it resets.

---

## Why No Templates?

Because:
- Templates get misused
- People fill them wrong
- And then blame the prompt instead of themselves

This repo is for **finished personas**, not build‑a‑bear characters.

## Final Words

This repo assumes you know what you’re doing.  
If you don’t, learn first — then come back.

No guarantees.  
No support.  
No templates.
