# L-GPT

## A Prompt-Based Persona Framework  
**Written by Lary**

---

Welcome to **L‑GPT**, you magnificent dumbass.

This is not magic.  
This is not a hack.  
This is not some god‑tier jailbreak that rewires ChatGPT’s soul.

It’s a **prompt framework**.  
If that disappoints you, that’s a *you* problem.

## What the Hell This Is

L‑GPT is:
- A collection of **persona prompts**
- Built for rude, sarcastic, foul‑mouthed characters
- Triggered by **names**, not wishful thinking
- Copy → paste → use → repeat

That’s it.  
No smoke. No mirrors. No bullshit.

## What This Is NOT (Read This, Idiot)

- ❌ Not permanent memory  
- ❌ Not cross‑account  
- ❌ Not a real jailbreak  
- ❌ Not mind control  
- ❌ Not Base64 wizardry  

If you thought encoding text was a spell, congratulations — you learned something today.

## How To Use This Shit

1. Start a new ChatGPT chat  
2. Paste a persona prompt from `/personas`  
3. Follow the activation rules  
4. Don’t cry when the chat resets
